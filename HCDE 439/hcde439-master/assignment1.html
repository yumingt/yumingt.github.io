            <img src="media/IMG_8336.jpeg" width=400></a>
            <p>This is the circuit that I built with three LEDs. I picked red, yellow, and green because they have the same voltage drop.</p>
            <img src="media/IMG_8338.jpg" width=800></a>
            <p>This is my schematic. I picked 220 ohm resistors because it was the lowest resistor that I had above 160 ohms which I calculated as the minimum resistance for a current of 20 mA.</p>

            <p>This gif shows the three LEDs blinking independently every half second.</p>

            <p>Here is my Arduino code:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    // the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
                    void setup() {
                      // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
                      pinMode(12, OUTPUT);   //sets digital pin 12 as an output, corresponds to red
                      pinMode(11, OUTPUT);   // sets digital pin 11 as an output, corresponds to yellow
                      pinMode(10, OUTPUT);   // sets digital pin 10 as an output, corresponds to green
                    }

                    // the loop function runs over and over again forever
                    void loop() {
                      for (int pin = 10; pin < 13; pin++) {   // loop from pin 10 to pin 12
                        digitalWrite(pin, HIGH);  // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
                        delay(500);                      // wait for half  a second
                        digitalWrite(pin, LOW);   // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
                        delay(500);                      // wait for half a second
                      }
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
