      <h2>FP2: Final Project Writeup</h2>
    </header>

    <h3>Click <a href="https://yumingt.github.io/quatrun/">here</a> to view my game!</h3>

    <h3>Overview and Usage</h3>
    <p>The core functionality of my project is to create a 2D endless runner using p5.play with a login flow that uses Firebase authentication and can also building a handheld controller that can be used to play the game using p5.serialserver. When playing the game with the controller, the left button is used to jump and the right button ends the game. If you hit an obstacle then the game is over. Here is a link to the GitHub repository where the code for my game is hosted: <a href="https://github.com/yumingt/quatrun">https://github.com/yumingt/quatrun</a></p>
    <p>Here is a gif of the Firebase login flow:</p>

    <h3>Development Process</h3>
    <p>Here are the steps that outline my process for this project since the prototype version:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Create, set up, and test the controller in a new repository</li>
      <li>Fix issues with deploying Firebase project. Here is a screenshot of my login page in an unfinished state before I figured out how to configure my styles correctly through Firebase hosting:</li>
      <img src="Screenshot (199).png" width="800"/>
      <li>Merge prototype version (Firebase login) with new repository (with p5.serialserver implementation)</li>
      <li>Add high score tracking feature</li>
      <li>Add BGM and sound effects</li>
      <li>Implement replay button</li>
      <li>Update html file of game with instructions.</li>
      <li>Center "Game over" sprite</li>
      <li>Push changes to Github and deploy project on Firebase</li>
      <li>Do the writeup</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Issue Deep-Dive</h3>
    <p>An issue that I encountered was that my p5 functions in sketch.js stopped running after I added in Firebased configuration code.</p>
    <p>I resolved this problem by...</p>
    <p>This fix taught me that...</p>
    <h3>Ideas and Future:</h3>
    <li>Add coin collection feature</li>
    <li>Add platforms that the player can jump onto</li>
    <li>Make the game speed up as score increases</li>
    <li>Purchase and connect a custom domain</li>
    <h3>Kudos</h3>
    <p>Thank you to my friend Aly Stuart for letting me use her artwork in this game and Professor Hannah Twigg-Smith for helping me debug my code.</p>
