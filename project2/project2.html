      <h2>MP2: Creative Coding with p5.js</h2>
    </header>

    <h3>Click <a href="gallery.html">here</a> to view my gallery!</h3>

    <h3>Overview and Usage</h3>
    <p>The core functionality of my project is to create a gallery page which displays various p5 sketches, including a static image, a static artwork with randomness, an infinite loop, an interactive sketch, a sketch that outputs audio, and a sketch that creates audio and visuals based on user input. Here is a link to the GitHub repository where the code for my sketches are hosted: <a href="https://github.com/yumingt/yumingt.github.io/tree/master/project2">https://github.com/yumingt/yumingt.github.io/tree/master/project2</a>. To run the code, simply clone the repository, and run it locally or copy the Javascript from the html files of each sketch into p5.</p>
    <p>Here is a gif of my p5 gallery:</p>

    <h3>Development Process</h3>
    <p>Here are the steps that outline my process for this project:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Make drafts of Sketches 1-6 on p5.js</li>
      <li>Create a gallery page and work on CSS layout</li>
      <li>Link all sketches onto gallery page</li>
      <li>Add screenshots/gifs of each sketch to the gallery page. Here is a screenshot of my project in an unfinished state as I was adding images to each block:</li>
      <img src="media/Screenshot (169).png" width="800"/>
      <li>Create an outline of project writeup</li>
      <li>Finalize writeup and link gallery to writeup page</li>
      <li>Push final code to GitHub</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Issue Deep-Dive</h3>
    <p>An issue that I encountered was that my sketches that involved audio did not play the audio when accessed from my gallery page even though it worked in the p5.js environment.</p>
    <p>I resolved this problem by adding the following script tags to the head of my html code:</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        &lt;script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/1.4.0/p5.js">&lt;/script>
        &lt;script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/1.4.0/addons/p5.sound.min.js">&lt;/script>
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>This fix taught me that I should always check to make sure that I've properly imported libraries before trying to use them.</p>
    <h3>Ideas and Future:</h3>
    <li>Add some color to static, random, and infinite loop sketches</li>
    <li>Add feature to save note sequences on audio and visuals sketch</li>
    <li>Create a new sketch that generates random loops based on audio input</li>
    <h3>Kudos</h3>
    <p>Thank you to the p5 documentation and Hannah for providing great example code.</p>
