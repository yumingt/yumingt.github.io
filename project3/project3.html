    <h3>Overview and Usage</h3>
    <p>The core functionality of my project is to create a 2D endless runner using p5.play. To play, just press space to jump over the obstacles. If you hit an obstacle then the game is over. Here is a link to the GitHub repository where the code for my game is hosted: <a href="https://github.com/yumingt/hcde438mp3" alt="Link to Github repository for game: https://github.com/yumingt/hcde438mp3">https://github.com/yumingt/hcde438mp3</a></p>
    <p>Here is a gif of my game:</p>

    <h3>Development Process</h3>
    <p>Here are the steps that outline my process for this project:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Develop concept of game</li>
      <li>Get permission from my friend Aly Stuart to use her PNG artwork as sprites</li>
      <li>Code functionality of game in p5 editor</li>
      <li>Convert PNGs into sprites. Here is a screenshot of my game in an unfinished state before I added the PNGs as sprites:</li>
      <img src="Screenshot (193).png" alt="Game in unfinished state where sprites are squares and triangles" width="800"/>
      <li>Set up development environment</li>
      <li>Transfer game from p5 editor to development environment</li>
      <li>Deploy game on Github pages</li>
      <li>Do the writeup</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Issue Deep-Dive</h3>
    <p>An issue that I encountered was that I struggled to set up my development environment because I was using an old version of Node.js from 2020.</p>
    <p>I resolved this problem by uninstalling Node.js, downloading the latest version, restarting my PC, creating a new repository for my game, and redoing the steps to set up a development environment.</p>
    <p>This fix taught me that I should always check to make sure that the packages and libraries that I am using are up to date.</p>
    <h3>Ideas and Future:</h3>
    <li>Add sound effects</li>
    <li>Add replay button</li>
    <li>Add menu screen</li>
    <h3>Kudos</h3>
    <p>Thank you to Anderson J Shaw for helping me debug my code.</p>
