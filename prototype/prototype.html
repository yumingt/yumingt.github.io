      <h2>FP1: Final Project Prototype</h2>
    </header>

    <h3>Click <a href="https://yumingt.github.io/quatrun/" alt="Link to prototype game: https://yumingt.github.io/quatrun/">here</a> to view my game!</h3>

    <h3>Overview and Usage</h3>
    <p>The core functionality of my project is to create a 2D endless runner using p5.play with a login flow that uses Firebase authentication. If you hit an obstacle then the game is over. Here is a link to the GitHub repository where the code for my game is hosted: <a href="https://github.com/yumingt/quatrun" alt="Link to Github repository for game: https://github.com/yumingt/quatrun">https://github.com/yumingt/quatrun</a></p>
    <p>Here is a gif of my prototype:</p>

    <h3>Development Process</h3>
    <p>Here are the steps that outline my process for this project:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Create Firebase project</li>
      <li>Add Firebase configuration into p5 code</li>
      <li>Debug various module and environment errors</li>
      <li>Style the login page with CSS. Here is a screenshot of my login page in an unfinished state before adding styles:</li>
      <img src="Screenshot (194).png" alt="Login screen with basic styles" width="800"/>
      <li>Deploy game on Github pages</li>
      <li>Do the writeup</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Issue Deep-Dive</h3>
    <p>An issue that I encountered was that I encountered many errors saying that I could not use import or export statements because my Firebase modules were not defined.</p>
    <p>I resolved this problem by using babel to translate my packages and modules into something that Node.js could understand which allowed my Firebase functionalities to work properly.</p>
    <p>This fix taught me that I should always check to make sure that my packages and modules are compatible with my server environments.</p>
    <h3>Project Scope</h3>
    <p>Now that I have completed my prototype, my project scope has narrowed because I realized that I probably won't have time to complete my reach goals, so will be removing the coin collection feature. I also did not have time to implement the replay button since I wanted to tackle the biggesst unknown first which was Firebase. However, I believe I will still be able to complete my Firebase high score tracking feature and build a physical controller to use p5.serialserver. If I have time I will also implement smaller features such as adding a replay button and adding BGM.</p>
    <h3>Time Management</h3>
    <p>The amount of time I spent building my prototype took much longer than my initial plan. There were there many unanticipated setbacks where I would spend a day trying to fix a bug which would end up breaking my code and I would have to start over.</p>
    <h3>Implementation Plan:</h3>
    <p>My implementation plan for my final version was cut down in scope now that I have completed my prototype? This has changed because I realize that more unanticipated setbacks may occur which will lessen the time I will have to implement the features that I initially wanted to add.</p>
    <p>Here is my updated plan:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>March 10th - Add high score tracking feature</li>
      <li>March 12th - Set up controller</li>
      <li>March 13th - Add BGM, sound effects, and replay button (if time)</li>
      <li>March 15th - Finish final version, work on portfolio</li>
      <li>March 17th - Finish FP2 final portfolio</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Ideas and Future:</h3>
    <li>Add Firebase functionality to save high scores</li>
    <li>Add replay button</li>
    <li>Use p5.serialserver to connect game with a physical controller</li>
    <li>Add sound effects and BGM</li>
    <h3>Kudos</h3>
    <p>Thank you to Anderson J Shaw for helping me debug my code as always.</p>
