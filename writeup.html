    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>I started creating my website by creating a barebones structure of what I wanted all the pages to look like. Here is an example of my cheatsheet page before it was finished to demonstrate the template that each page follows:</p>
    <img
      src="./process.png"
      width="700"
      height="400"
    />
    <p>After creating the structure, I also created a nav bar which I made sure to add to each page. Finally, once the template for each page was done, I added the text and images specific to each page to finish the website.</p>
    <h3>Issue</h3>
    <p>One issue I encountered was being unable to push my changes through the command line. I solved this issue by using GitHub Desktop to push all my changes an it worked.</p>
    <h3>CSS Transition</h3>
    <p>The CSS transition I piced was animating the color of a text link on hover because I thought it looked cool. I made it work by researching methods of how to do this on Stackoverflow before I implemented and tested it myself</p>

    />
    <h3>Ideas and Future:</h3>
    <li>Clean up CSS code</li>
    <li>Add more cool styles</li>
    <li>Restructure Portfolio</li>
